Okay. We can start now.
0:02
Yeah. Again.
0:11
Wanted to apologize. The room is a bit small for everybody.
0:15
Cranked in during the quiz. Maybe a little bit hot, so hopefully it's okay.
0:19
How do you feel about the quizzes? It were getting better.
0:30
Okay. You get used to it. The rhythms. Every week you study and make sure you do all the exercise on the slides and understand things should be okay.
0:38
All right. So today we're going to move on. Uh, yet another topic.
0:50
So this topic is called the finding Similar sets.
0:56
Remember last time we were talking about five being frequent items.
1:00
Okay. But today the items become more complicated.
1:05
Like last week was that item milk is, uh.
1:10
Is an item. So milk. Milk. So. But today milk has components in there and lots of stuff in there.
1:14
So how do we find that? Okay. So specifically we're going to do motivate the similar, uh items.
1:22
But notice that sometimes I say similar items, sometimes similar sets because each item now is a set.
1:30
All right. So then we're going to discuss the three steps to find them.
1:38
This is a very challenging problem. So a common metaphor about this is that you want to find on internet pages that with similar words.
1:44
Okay. Now each page is a item, but inside a page there are lots of lots of words.
1:58
It could be English words or French or Italian, whatever it is.
2:05
Another thing is example is that customers who purchased similar products.
2:10
Now, in this case, the things that you want to find the similarity is between customers.
2:19
But each customer is not just a a picture or ID because they buy a lot of products.
2:25
Okay. Those I think. And then the last one would be image.
2:33
With similar features. Notice that we want to find the similar images.
2:36
That depends on how many features in the image that are similar to each item or each things.
2:42
We try to find the similarity. Has a lot of stuff in it.
2:50
So on the top we are finding near neighbors in high dimensional space, high dimensional,
2:55
because every item or every product or every page is actually a big thing.
3:03
It's not a small one thing. Okay. That's the motivation.
3:10
Formulate the problem to be solved is that you are given a larger set of high dimensional data points.
3:16
Each point is a very high dimension.
3:23
Lots of lots of things in it. And then you want it to find those sets that are similar to each other by giving a distance function.
3:27
And you can use this distance function to measure how similar they are.
3:39
Okay. We're going to talk to you about what are the distance functions.
3:43
Then we wanted to find all the pairs of points that I have are within some distance threshold.
3:47
And you can see there are many similarities between these and the one that we talked about last week.
3:56
Typically a naive solution, you have to go through the m points and N times.
4:03
So it's n square because you have to compare every points which has n dimension and so on.
4:10
And so. And you were looking for uh, but we are saying that square solution is too slow.
4:17
We're looking for a linear solution. Okay. So a little bit of review of what I had last week.
4:24
Remember we were trying to keep a counting site.
4:34
Um, which pair has showed up how many times?
4:38
But the problem is that there's so many, uh, pairs are there?
4:42
So if you keep track, if you want to keep a counter for every possible pairs, there's just be too many.
4:47
So we have a clever way. Organize those, uh, pairs into a linear order.
4:56
But conceptually speaking, looks like a triangle.
5:02
And then whenever you want to increase somebody's counter and you give an integer,
5:06
you go through this list and you can pinpoint which counter you want to increase.
5:12
Okay, that's quite a triangle way. The other one is that if you don't have too many pairs to consider and you can wedding,
5:18
you're going to willing to pay three integers counter meaning you're going to remember I and the j plus the counter c itself.
5:26
So these two approach depends on how many pairs you are have.
5:36
If you need to consider all the possible pairs, you better consider the triangle one.
5:42
But you know, yeah, no more than two third of the pairs uh, needs to be considered.
5:48
Maybe you can use the second approach. Okay, so this is the last time we talk about.
5:56
We also talk about some extensions like CP, lb, PCI in the.
6:03
We're trying to make use of the free memories in the first pass by creating buckets I think are you crazy buckets today.
6:09
So hopefully you know what I mean by buckets now.
6:20
So pairs that get throw into the buckets and the buckets keep track of how many things have been thrown in how many times.
6:23
And that is above the threshold. You say, okay, this bucket is frequent.
6:31
However you don't remember which has got throw in and how many times you just
6:36
know there are enough time has been thrown into something into that bucket.
6:42
Okay. Okay. Now, the reason we use bokeh.
6:46
Is can some way say a very short sentence.
6:52
Why we're using bucket in this case? What is the significance of buckets?
6:56
To fair all the candidates. If it's a good candidate you want to fill out.
7:07
Yeah, the hopeless candidness. That's right. So we get it because we use this method.
7:14
The things we kick it out. They just hopeless.
7:20
So we don't lose anything. All right. So because the memory is an issue, then we are looking for things that wanted to.
7:23
Efficiently representing the the things that we find.
7:33
So today we are finding similar items except the item today is a big set itself.
7:37
You can think of each item is a document. It's a document.
7:45
Is a lot of English word in there. And then you have to go through all the words and see how key.
7:50
And these two documents similar. Right. So each item is a set of objects or components.
7:56
And we can call them as a uh, uh, pieces inside uh the items.
8:06
Now we have, uh, problem becomes finding similar sets, meaning that we trying to find items have contains the similar objects.
8:14
Okay, so the challenge is that the size is big, and then each document or each item is also big.
8:25
So it's a double big the big of number of items.
8:33
And the item itself is also big. Okay, so that's Lee.
8:38
And then we wanted to find the similar. What do we mean by similar items.
8:45
Meaning that if you apply a function to that two documents and it will return a number,
8:49
if that number is above some a given threshold, then you say these two pairs are similar.
8:59
Yeah. Again this the the threshold are given to you.
9:08
Okay. Today we're going to introduce one over the functions to do this called the Jaccard distance okay.
9:12
So the goal is to find, uh, nearly duplicate pairs of large object, uh, large items.
9:22
Okay. Application wise, including you want to find on the internet, what are the mirroring websites?
9:29
Mirroring may means that they are sort of nearly identical to each other.
9:37
Right. And also, you wanted to find the similar news articles, uh, related to this class.
9:43
And we have an agent running these to find similar submissions, uh, in homework submissions.
9:50
And compared to all the known objects that on the internet, uh, in the past the semesters.
9:59
So those uh, when another application of these.
10:06
So the challenge is that, as I mentioned, there are two big.
10:11
One is a large number of items to be considered.
10:15
The other one is each item is so big they have so many things in it.
10:20
And how do we deal with this. So that's the.
10:25
So to do this today or tonight, we're going to tell you the three steps and some of the steps similar to what we talked about last week.
10:28
But there are some key ideas. It's not a straightforward.
10:39
And you have to listen carefully when we mention except especially when do the second.
10:44
And do you uh, second step kind of mini hashing.
10:49
Okay. Just bear with me and hear what I'm saying.
10:53
Then you should be okay. So the big picture we have three steps.
10:57
First of all, we know that each item is very big, like a document come in lots of document.
11:02
So we want to shrink it. Shrink it big document to something smaller.
11:10
So what have we we're going to do is called uh shingling.
11:15
Anybody know what is shingling? Any idea?
11:20
Anybody living in United States for many years. Or you own a house?
11:27
Yes. What is shingling? I think that's because. Overlap, right?
11:32
Yes. Document with overlapping bits. Yeah.
11:36
Where? In the common environment. Where do you find the shingles?
11:40
Ruth. On the roof. We have a lots of, uh.
11:46
Um, shingles overlapping on each other, but it's a big roof.
11:52
But it is made by lots of little shingles that covered the roof.
11:58
Okay, so we using this idea to reduce a bigger document into a set of shingles.
12:02
Second step. Even those shingles are still too big.
12:09
We're going to shrink the document into something very small called the signatures.
12:13
And those signatures better be good because you are checking if two documents are similar.
12:20
Now you're shrinking the big things into smaller things. They better be similar as well.
12:26
Otherwise you lose the original. And then last one is even the signature is too vague.
12:32
Then when we do, the hashing is like we did the bucket idea we did last time, and then we further to do that,
12:40
all these steps are reduce the number of candidates by kicking out all the pairs that are hopeless.
12:47
And then we only consider finally a set of.
12:57
Pairs that I have some meaningful hope.
13:02
Okay. Shingle for a step.
13:07
Now we convert documents to a set. Set of what?
13:11
Set of words? Okay.
13:16
They said, let's say you have a. Shingo has a size.
13:19
Say you have a Shingo. Certain size. That means that you're looking for a sequence of words in the document.
13:23
Makes it abcdefg. Those are where maybe you say I am a Stu, then in US.
13:31
See, that's a sentence. And that's also a Shingo.
13:38
Yeah. Not. Depends on how many, how long that little Shingo you are looking for.
13:42
So we sort of representing those documents by all the possible shingles are there.
13:47
Of course, there are lots of shingles, right? Do you know how big it is?
13:55
The Weber English dictionary. How many English words are there?
13:59
The dictionary is very thick. Okay. 300,000 or something like that.
14:07
We daily life, we don't use that many. But imagine documents and then there are lots of them.
14:12
So what we do these is that we're going to representing document by case shingle.
14:19
What does it mean. Means that tokens uh each could it be a word or the character.
14:23
The lens of that is k. Now here is a very simple example.
14:30
Let's say I have a document D one huge document contains a b c a b very big right?
14:36
So I wanted to represent that document by two shingles.
14:46
What does that mean. So I have to consider in this document what are the two words.
14:52
Are there. So here a b b c c a, then c a again and then ab again.
14:59
So we already have a ab so we don't need to repeat.
15:08
So then we have the three shingles. There the three shingles are the.
15:11
Let me get my pan. Yeah.
15:19
Okay. It's funny.
15:39
Every time I take the pen out, I have to sort of charge it a little bit.
15:42
So here AB, BC and CA. These are called the set.
15:49
Meaning there's no duplicates. Sometimes we use bag.
15:55
A bag of shingles instead of a set.
16:01
If you use a bag, that means we allow duplicates.
16:05
Abby. Abby. Okay, so now you see this small example.
16:09
You know what I mean by shingle. All right. Now the caveat is that you must pick a shingle size large enough.
16:17
Now here's the interesting question. When you have a better you compared to case five and ten.
16:26
Which set of Shingo has more in it? As a K goes up, the number of machine goes, it goes up or goes down.
16:35
Goes down. Somebody saying go down. Anybody say go up.
16:45
The longer Shingo is, there are more possibilities of shingle.
16:52
Because the following. Let's say I have an other alphabet.
16:59
Uh. Let's say 26 English alphabet.
17:05
Okay. If I consider Zingo five. How many possible singles are there?
17:10
But he is not racing hand. But he's holding very high.
17:20
Yeah. You're thinking something else, right? Any idea, consider you have alphabet ABCd 26, uh, letters.
17:25
Now, if I say shingle, save six.
17:37
How many possible shingles are there? Say it again.
17:41
26 C6. No. You have 26.
17:49
To the power of five. Is 26.
17:56
Multiply by 26. Multiply because you have five.
18:01
Position each position you can fill in one of the 26.
18:05
So be 26, 26, 26, 26.
18:09
Now if I have a k equals nine, that means 26 to the power of nine.
18:13
These are many, many possible angles. Of course, not all the documents have all the shingles in it.
18:20
It just some documents has these set of shingles. Some documents had the other set of shingles.
18:29
But the number of possible shingles as the K goes up that number goes exponentially quickly.
18:34
Okay. All right. Suppose we want to representing these shingles and order them in alphabetical order from beginning to the end.
18:43
All right. Now, if I give index for all these shingles, I only allow myself, say, 23 bits of four bytes of integer.
18:53
How many shingles I can represent? Is two to the power 32 because each side has two, I have a 32 bits.
19:06
That means this is the number of things I can represent here, right?
19:20
Okay. I have a detailed example to show you up.
19:25
Okay. See here. We already consider to change that down command to three.
19:28
K equals two shingles. Right.
19:36
Then notice that this is ABCd.
19:41
I can name them say ab. I know is the number one shingle because I we order things alphabetically.
19:45
Okay. So it's 1BC is five and k is eight.
19:55
So you use an integer to representing a shingle.
20:00
Okay. That's another representation trick that we do.
20:07
So we from the document we go to Shingo.
20:12
And then for each for the shingles we use integer to remember.
20:15
If I say shingle number five.
20:21
What is the shingle? We're talking about SPC.
20:24
Right. You see that? Okay, so it's a representation.
20:29
Now here. Suppose I have two characters. Very small language, only x and Y, and I have two shingles.
20:33
Clearly I can do x x x, y y x and y y for all of them.
20:40
Right now. So we do have a choice how big the key is.
20:47
Right. So let me consider two cases. Let's say we have a language, have a 20 characters instead of a 26 like English.
20:52
So we can say okay all right. So I want to consider k equals 4k equals nine.
21:02
When k equals four. How many shingles are there? 20 to the power four.
21:10
When that shingle is nine, there's 20 to the power of nine.
21:19
There are lots of lots of them. Okay. Now, looking at the four byes, we choose the representing the shingles.
21:24
How many numbers I can representing is two to the power of 32.
21:33
Compare these number. To the number of shingles.
21:40
Okay. If I decided to use four by three representing my shingles.
21:44
Is there a better to choose for? She goes? Or is there better to choose?
21:50
Nine shingles. Four.
21:54
Why? Yeah.
21:58
What do you mean by memory? This requires more memory.
22:04
Yeah. Now you have this many index power.
22:09
If you only use four shingles. This is how many shingle you have.
22:16
So there are a lot of integers getting wasted. Integers.
22:22
We use integers to represent in shingles.
22:27
Now you give me a big set of integers. A small set of a shingle.
22:31
What? Are you wasting something? Yes. So it's better to choose number of k so that the resulting number of shingles is greater than this number.
22:35
So because it's okay sometimes five it could be representing two shingles.
22:47
But memory wise we are fully use of these four bytes.
22:52
Okay. This is a choice we can make.
22:59
All right. So this is a one thing. Now the reason that we want two more shingles than the index.
23:03
Why? Because we can do a little bit of hashing. But we don't want to waste a memory.
23:12
Okay. You understand? Right? Yeah. Any questions?
23:18
All right. So here is a question that we may ask you in the quiz.
23:22
Say why is it better to have nine shingles?
23:27
Uh, to four bytes. Compared to has four singles to four bites.
23:32
Right. Because you want it to be more shingles than the the index powers you are using.
23:39
Okay. Hope is clear. Right? Okay.
23:49
For goes you have this many which is less than two to the power.
23:53
So question. Yeah. Change the number of fingers so that you're not going to be approximately two is due to the both of you.
23:59
Yes, you can do that. But when you have a choice, is it above the number of single or below?
24:11
You better want it to be above. Okay.
24:17
And then you have a nice shingles. This is the number clearly is more.
24:23
Okay. Question. Can we use like 10 or 15?
24:28
Yes you can use that. I just gave these two examples to illustrate the choice.
24:31
Like this. What? Depends on how.
24:36
How many. Let's say you wanted to use a 100 shingle.
24:40
How many shingles are there? You have 100.
24:46
To the power of 20. Let's say your character is 20.
24:51
Now this is too big a number to handle by four bytes.
24:56
You better allocated more than four bytes to two, representing that you don't want it to be too little, but you don't want to be too many.
25:01
That every number ribbon is hundreds of thousands of shingles.
25:11
That would be too bad, because eventually you have to use the index to find the real shingle.
25:15
If it's too many choices, it would be too bad. Okay, so similar method.
25:23
Now, now we have what? Okay. Question.
25:28
Yeah. Um, for example, are you looking for. You know.
25:31
Look at me. What do you mean?
25:36
How big the number? When you use four bytes.
25:40
Uh, when you use. You said a four bytes. Yeah.
25:45
For the using. Yeah, they've done that because a lot.
25:49
That I do not quite know. Let's say typical, eh?
25:56
English document. How long is it? Maybe average 20 pages long.
26:01
Right. So if you talk about book, it will be even bigger.
26:11
That's why we spend the whole night to talk about how you change the big sets into that.
26:17
For now, you have a choice of okay. You wanted to pick, okay?
26:22
So that you don't waste your money and your memory.
26:28
No money. Yeah, okay. Now.
26:31
We used to. We'll begin with two big documents.
26:36
Now, what do we have? We change the documents?
26:40
Into what? A set of white.
26:43
Numbers, right? Yeah. Okay.
26:48
Now we have two sets of number one. How do we measure the similarity between the two sets of number?
26:53
Clearly we have to look at okay, what number numbers in there when the number is there and see how do they intersect.
27:02
And this is a measurement that you can't similarity.
27:10
So you have a two sets of whatever it is number of people or items or whatever
27:15
it is that your cost similarity is defined by the intersection of two sets,
27:22
the cardinality divided by the union of the two sets.
27:30
Now can somebody tell me what is the biggest, the number you can get from this?
27:36
But what is the smallest? Zero.
27:42
Yeah. So is it between the one and the zero? Okay. Yeah.
27:46
So here is very simple. I have two sets. Two circles there.
27:49
The intersection is between. Those are three dots in there.
27:55
So clearly it's three divided by eight.
27:58
So each dots representing something in the set.
28:05
Okay. All right. Now don't confuse.
28:09
This is a code. Similarity is defined by this.
28:14
Now if I say distance. So when you do the quiz, please be careful.
28:18
We are asking for your distance. Or we are asking for similarity.
28:24
If we talk about distance, you have to say one minus the similarity.
28:29
Okay. If we talk about similarity.
28:35
And that's just the definition of that. Okay.
28:39
So the first step is quite easy. Now we are representing documents by shingle.
28:42
And then we're running shingles by numbers. So now we're talking about two sets of numbers.
28:49
And we're trying to see if these two sets of numbers are similar to each other or not.
28:57
So overall now we're going to go to the second step because it means hashing.
29:03
And then because once we do the similarity, we're changing the two documents to be the two sets of numbers.
29:08
But we still have to compare every pair of documents.
29:17
Right. So pairwise similarity.
29:21
You gave me one document. The other document. I need to compute the similarity I have to do through the pair wisely.
29:25
I have to do five. Multiply by the ten to the power of 11.
29:32
Compare comparisons. That takes five days.
29:38
Lots of time, so it takes too long for millions of documents, but it takes over a year.
29:43
It's not possible. Okay. So that we have to do something really clever.
29:51
And every time we have these tough problems,
29:57
you we have to thank in the previous researches to come up with these clever ideas that you are learning in the class.
30:01
So what are we going to do is we're going to use the means hashing to changing the big set of number into set of signatures,
30:08
and then the signatures are considerably smaller.
30:20
And then we will uh, uh, use the signature to check whether these two, a pair of things should be, uh, above the threshold and maybe not.
30:23
So whatever we do after we get a signature, one property will have to be maintained very carefully is they have to preserve similarity.
30:36
Meaning that if the original two document are similar and then you shrink them into similar signature, the two signatures should be also similar.
30:49
If the original two pair a pair are not similar when you.
30:59
Shrinking to this signature and your signature should not be similar.
31:04
Otherwise, it's not a good thing to do. Okay.
31:09
So now we are representing documents by sets.
31:15
And then we can organize these sets by pooling matrix.
31:21
What I mean is the following. In this table.
31:25
Pay attention. Okay. How many documents I have.
31:30
For S12 and three four.
31:36
Right. How many shingles I have? Five.
31:39
A b c d e. Of course this is just illustration I in the real one.
31:44
This this table or matrix. This is huge. Could I have a millions of documents and then how many shingles are there?
31:49
Depends on the k you choose. Huge number right now.
31:58
In this case, we wanted to say okay, who is similar to who?
32:04
Look at those four documents. Can you tell me who is more similar than the other?
32:09
As when and as for. They are similar because. Row number one.
32:17
Row number four they are the same. Now what does a there's a zero there.
32:21
What does that mean. When the column has a zero, what's the value zero means there.
32:27
That means that particular shingle is not in that particular document.
32:35
Look for a is not in two and three, but it is in one and S4.
32:41
Okay, so. We used to have a number.
32:50
Now we even changed the number to become binary.
32:55
Zero. No one's. The price that we pay is we organize them by a big table.
33:00
So now everything there is zero. And the ones.
33:07
Okay, that's another big step. So now you should understand how do we get these bit matrix.
33:12
Because we coming from documents documents become shingle.
33:21
Shingle becomes a number. And now number we organize the number like these.
33:25
And then now it has a zero. And the ones in the table.
33:32
Okay, this is a quarter. What is the name of these matrix called?
33:37
Yeah, it's called pulling matrix.
33:44
Pooling means zero and the one. Okay. Now we already we are clever enough to say s1 S4 they are similar.
33:47
Can someone tell me what's the measurement? How similar?
33:58
Why is it two? Because yeah, there are two similar.
34:06
Okay. How many total? Five.
34:12
No union. Three.
34:19
Okay, so because s. Sorry, the Syria is unnecessary as well as for when you do the union, there are three.
34:23
Got it. That's why it's 230. Okay.
34:34
Very good. So we can compute.
34:39
Gave you two columns, um, zero ones.
34:42
And then you can tell me what's the similarity in this case is what?
34:47
How many, uh, similar. Uh, intersection are these two rows?
34:54
Total Union is 12345.
34:59
That's why it is two over five. Okay. Understand that you can't simulate is quite easy to compute.
35:04
Okay, so what are we going to do? Is the when the similar is interesting we went to analyze and why.
35:14
What kind of things. If we look at the two bit columns how do we determine we where they are.
35:21
They are similar. So we want now the thing is now finding similar columns.
35:29
The columns are representing by the bits okay.
35:37
And okay. So we wanted to shrink it to a signature I said we mention that I tell you how do we construct a signature.
35:42
Pay attention to uh okay. So compared to all the signatures said to be get.
35:51
That's why I have a number of three. So but before that I wanted to ask you this question.
35:59
Let's say now you have two columns. Zeros and ones.
36:06
Okay. Now you can think of these as a two documents.
36:11
Uh, you like it? So I think of this two books.
36:16
You. And then you go to library. There's so many books and you say, okay, I want to find all the books that are similar to each other.
36:20
Boy, you have to do a lot of readings, right? Now here is the challenge question for you.
36:27
Do you have any idea how can I shrink the book into small signatures so that.
36:33
If the two signatures are similar. The original book a similar.
36:42
I gave you one minute to think about it. Of course, a researcher's takes years to come back and see if you can come up with the idea in one minute.
36:49
Anything goes. Huh?
37:00
Say louder. Plots. How do you plot a book?
37:05
I give you two book. Now, how do you get the plots?
37:10
You have to read it. When you read the book time by the library.
37:17
There are so many books. Yes, we can pick a random.
37:23
Uh huh. I say okay. Okay.
37:32
That that's that's a good idea, right? Just open it up.
37:36
Pick a random page. But when you pick a random page, do you the two books that go to the same page or different page?
37:40
Okay, here's a different page that has a disadvantage.
37:49
Okay. Any other ideas? We.
37:54
Mhm. So? Well, that takes too long.
38:00
Because you have to go through the whole section in the book.
38:06
But your idea is a hitting something. Continue.
38:11
You say random one. What is the easiest?
38:15
The random page you can look. Uh.
38:19
The cover. Yeah.
38:28
So you take the book. You only look at the cover.
38:32
You remember your English saying, never judge a book by the cover.
38:36
Now we're judging by the cover, of course, you take to work.
38:41
You look at the covers. Are they similar? And you say, okay, I'm going to take these as a result.
38:46
Now, what do you do next is that you randomly permuted the pages.
38:51
And you pick the same pages. I get the.
38:57
You shuffling all the pages. Shuffling all the pages.
39:00
But the shuffling is the same. Shuffling. Now you have two new cover pages.
39:04
And you say, I'm shaking the new cover pages. As part of my signature.
39:11
You do it a number of times. Let's say you do it a 200 times.
39:16
Now you have a signature of 200 bits.
39:20
Amazing. This is. What are we going to use? Okay.
39:26
How do we do that? Okay. Now, I'm telling you the main idea.
39:30
Now I'm telling you. How do we do this? Okay. Here we go.
39:35
So we're going to hash each column into a small set of a signature.
39:41
This is where they say we're going to representing the column as a see the signature as the result.
39:45
Okay. So signatures should be small enough.
39:52
And also signatures need to preserve the similarity.
39:56
That's the only two criteria. So the key idea as we mentioned to judge a book by the cover.
40:01
Now in this case before we analyze it, notice that we have the two columns all the zero and the bits right.
40:08
We can classify every possible rose by four types.
40:18
Type A, they both have one. Type B, one of them has one, the other is zero.
40:24
Type C is zero. One type of D is zero zero.
40:32
When we consider Jakarta similarity, notice that this type of d.
40:37
Consider be part of the similarity so we can safely ignore type D.
40:43
We pay attention to the things that has one in it.
40:51
If we both have zero, we don't need to. Okay. Because in due similarity, this is the union of, you know, the the intersection divided by union.
40:56
Now what is intersection is actually a so how many type of A's you have.
41:09
Divided up by the union of A plus B plus C.
41:16
How many type of those? Okay. So this is a little bit kinked.
41:19
So this is the unit D never contribute in the picture.
41:24
Okay, so how do we do the mean hashing is saying that we're going to find the index number of the first row in which this column has a one in it.
41:30
This is why the name of mean hashing meaning means you start from the top.
41:44
You go down looking for where is the first one you see in the column?
41:51
It's like you're looking at a cover page over two books, but in your head there was a lot of shingles,
41:56
and you look down and say, oh, this cover page is which shingle corresponded to this cover page.
42:03
That's the first one you're looking at. So in here.
42:10
Now pay attention to these slides is very important. Okay.
42:14
How do we do. The mean index will look at each column.
42:18
Find the where is the index where there is one.
42:22
Okay first s one. First column.
42:26
Where's the index? It is a.
42:33
Because the shin, the first shingle, has a one in S1.
42:38
Okay, now the second column is. What? See.
42:43
Third one will be. The last one.
42:49
Hey. Okay. Now I have constructed a part of the signature.
42:54
Now notice that I can also. Shuffling the pages by shuffling the pages.
43:05
I really just. Permuted the rows.
43:12
Whatever I wanted to permute. Okay, that's a quarter.
43:16
Permutation. Permutation means that you have the same set.
43:20
But are you shuffling the orders? So in this case, you see that I move the, uh, row B to the top, a row to the second.
43:25
A is now third and and D in the C.
43:36
So this is a one permutation okay.
43:39
Now before the permutation I did that part of it.
43:43
And then I shuffle in the pager. I do it again. Okay.
43:46
So this is let us see how do we construct the signature.
43:50
Yeah. Here we go. So notice that don't confuse with the original index.
43:53
The original indexes went to 34566 because that's how you order your shingles originally.
44:01
Now when you permuted the index, I changed.
44:07
Right. So number two in the text and now is on the top.
44:12
Okay. When you're searching things down, whenever you do a after permutation,
44:17
you should follow the top down the red things to search in that way so that you get the second part.
44:22
So the first part, we already did A and the C and the B and A.
44:30
Right now I'm going to shuffling. How do I shuffle this?
44:36
This is the shuffling. Notice that.
44:44
Row number one used to be on the top.
44:51
Now I put them. I call that row number one and number three.
44:55
Why is the number one role in this suffering?
45:01
Each one is right here. Okay.
45:06
Now, if I construct the signature after these shuffling.
45:12
Yeah. No, you tell me. Looking at the first column.
45:16
I have to check. Look, this. Is that a one?
45:22
No. So I now look at number two.
45:26
Is that a one? Yes. That's why here has two.
45:29
It's the smallest index that showed up in that column.
45:35
Everybody see that? All right. Now look at the second column.
45:43
Again. You started with here one. Is that a one?
45:49
Yes. So that's why that's a one. Yeah.
45:53
Me changing the order. Yeah. Yeah. USC.
46:04
Anybody has any other question. This is the key slides.
46:09
Okay. Very very important. Yes. Go ahead.
46:13
So the rose we don't shuffle. The rose.
46:17
We. Yes. Constant index.
46:20
Yes. Yes. The reason we have a reason why to do that.
46:24
Because you don't want to shuffle the pages. It's a lot of work.
46:28
Instead of you just changing the index. It's so easy.
46:32
Okay. Now look at it. Column three.
46:37
You can tell me again. You check here this row first.
46:41
That's a zero. And then you check the number two. Oh, that's a one.
46:46
That's why it's that. And that's why it's one. Okay.
46:50
Now I'm going to do the second shuffling.
46:54
Uh, permutation. It's the blue.
46:57
Now, which one is? Look at this first column. This is the first place you look because that's a one, right?
47:02
Is that a one? No. Then you look at the second place.
47:10
Is that a one? Yes, that's why it's two.
47:14
Now look at the number three thing you've started with.
47:21
This column is this one? No.
47:25
Second column. Second row. Is this true?
47:29
No. And the three? Is this one?
47:33
No. And then before is this one.
47:36
Yes. See, that's wise for. Yeah.
47:41
Go ahead. Isn't something being taken same as in the matrix?
47:48
Yes. Yes. Yes. Later. You don't go ahead. I mean, just concentrate on this part.
47:54
So now I'm shuffling the third time. The purple one.
47:59
Okay, so now one and the two is down here.
48:05
Right. Again you will find the one two, one, two.
48:10
So if I shuffle three times I get a signature of three bit three numbers.
48:15
What are those numbers representing the cover page after you've shot?
48:25
The mean index. Okay.
48:33
So this is a a key slides for tonight.
48:37
And then you need to completely understand this.
48:41
Uh it's a bit confusion if you just read the book by yourself without hire me to saying all these words.
48:45
It's it's really hard to get it. Okay. All right.
48:54
Very good. Any questions? What does that.
48:58
Cover page. Index is representing the smallest index for which that particular document has a shingle in it.
49:02
So again that number represents the shingles.
49:18
Showed up on the cover page after you do the shuffling.
49:25
So there are. No.
49:31
In this case I shall shuffle three times.
49:38
So then there is only three kind of three top pages.
49:41
Every shuffling. What to begin with.
49:46
You have the book. Original book. They have their cover.
49:50
Right. You take that as it is. Of course. Then you take all the pages.
49:54
Shuffle, shuffle. Some pages will be on the top.
49:59
That is, this number representing this number representing the shingles showed up on the top.
50:04
When you do after you do the shuffling. Literary is judging a book by the cover.
50:12
Yeah. Question. Yeah. I don't understand the bugbear of putting a document where somebody signals to them the numbers.
50:20
Round numbers already lined up over here. Oh, okay.
50:31
We had a we did a four steps. Documents to shingles.
50:36
Shingles to the numbers. Now those numbers representing shingles.
50:41
Don't forget okay. When I say two is number two shingles.
50:46
All right. Okay. That's the answer to your question.
50:53
So now we converted the numbers into binary index.
50:56
The binary index is just showing that. Okay. In this particular document, a column which shingles is in that.
51:03
Right. And then you say, okay, the number one shingle.
51:11
And you look at the index. That's the shingle name for that shingle.
51:16
Yeah. Yeah. Question. Do we. That has been duplicated within a single.
51:21
We don't care. We don't care if it's a duplicate that you have.
51:28
The Shingo showed up several times. Remember.
51:34
Long time ago. It depends on whether you have a set. What do I mean by set or bank?
51:40
Do you remember? Yeah. If we talk about set, there's no duplicates.
51:47
Each document is represented by a set of shingles.
51:53
This slides. Uh.
52:00
One more. One more. There. There it is.
52:03
There. We can also do this. Yeah, you could do.
52:06
This is bad. But for now, it's a set. Just put that in your head.
52:11
Okay. Okay.
52:18
Very good. This is the key idea. I think if we pass it and understand it and then we are good.
52:24
All right. Now, after we did this. Now we really come up with what?
52:32
Now every document becomes a small signature.
52:37
How small? How many times you shuffling. And because I was shuffling three times, I get this.
52:43
Each signature is a three. See, this is one signature.
52:51
Maybe my pen is out of battery. Okay.
53:05
Good. This is the signature for S1, signature for S2, signature for S3 and S4.
53:12
Okay. All right. Very good. Now we're looking at these signals.
53:24
Are they good? But how do we know if its signature is a good.
53:27
I told you in two slides ago. How do we know if signatures are good?
53:34
Yes, you the signatures better to preserve the similarity of the original document.
53:42
Otherwise, yeah, you can collaborate. Judge a book by a cover.
53:50
If it's don't do that, then this is useless. Okay, so let's compare signature with the original document and see how do they do it.
53:54
Okay so this is the import of matrix.
54:05
And we did the shuffling three times. We get these four signatures and neither tragedies pen Constantine maybe.
54:09
All right. Now let's do the similarity measurement.
54:18
This column represents the document to document the similarity.
54:23
Between 1 and 3. How similar are these in the matrix?
54:30
1 in 3. This is one.
54:39
That's three. Three by four. Okay, that's a three by four.
54:44
Everybody see why it's a three by four okay.
54:49
Right. Two and a four. So it's a two and four.
54:52
How similar are they. Again.
54:57
Three by four. One and two. How similar are they?
55:01
Zero. And three and four. How similar they.
55:06
Zero. Everybody see that? Now look at the signatures.
55:11
Between signature one and signature three.
55:16
What are the similarity? Two by three.
55:20
See, these two are very good. Now look at the two and the four signature.
55:30
Whereas similarity. One.
55:36
Compared to that is also pretty good now compared to one and two.
55:41
What are the similarity between them? Zero.
55:45
And the zero. Look. Are these good signatures?
55:50
Yes. Isn't as beautiful. Yeah.
55:57
Question. Yeah. Can you prove. Yes, of course I can prove.
56:02
But we don't test you in the quiz. Say prove this.
56:07
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You okay? Why?
56:12
Like where? You're. Okay.
56:15
Look at two. Three. Okay, now the union of between 1 and 3.
56:19
So look at these one and the three.
56:25
Okay. So two and two on the same. So the union have it one and one also the same.
56:29
So you have a two union. Uh intersection divide by the have three columns.
56:36
And that's why it's two over three. Because you remember this.
56:42
Jaka Picard. Uh, Jaka. Jakarta. Similarity is the union.
56:47
Uh, is the intersection divided by the union?
56:52
Got it. Okay. Yeah. It's going to be critical.
56:57
You're going to do this because we're not going to approve this for you.
57:03
Okay. Don't just believe me. All right.
57:06
Yeah. Because if I test you to prove ability, you've.
57:11
The quiz. Nobody can answer that. Yeah. Okay.
57:18
Why is it? Why is that good?
57:22
You tell me. I repeated it three times.
57:25
Yeah, because they preserve similarity.
57:30
The original documents. If they are similar, my signature is also similar.
57:34
If they are not similar. And my signature is not similar.
57:42
So that means my signature. Preserve the similarity.
57:47
That's why they're good. Yeah, 1 or 2.
57:52
They're both zeros. One for you to forward to?
58:02
Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay.
58:06
Very good. So now we got a signatures.
58:11
How big is the signature defense? You can sort of. Yeah.
58:14
I'm going to shuffle it to 200 times. Then you each document become 200 numbers.
58:18
Sequence of numbers. Okay. That sequence is important.
58:25
Because that's how they all commonly shuffling by the same way.
58:30
Yeah. So that's all we have to avoid.
58:35
Uh, doing the singularity. Right?
58:40
Right. So then if we are not doing that, then how will we know that it's a good thing?
58:43
You have to do the dumbest away just to read the book from the beginning to the end and see how many things there are similar.
58:49
That's the most honest way to do it. But we are trying to kick out those hopeless pairs of books.
58:58
They have no way they're going to be similar. So then we don't need to read them from beginning to the end.
59:06
Yeah. So when you said preserving similarity. Like, um, because I think if there's a correlation.
59:13
We don't use the word correlation. Yeah. Similarity.
59:22
Yeah. We only preserve similarity, for example.
59:28
We are all student sitting here, right? Let's say I'm going to shrink you.
59:34
You as your ID. And then I judge you by the ID and then we have, let's say, 200 ideas in my say, okay, who is a good student or who is similar to me?
59:38
I would look at the IDs if they are similar to each other and they say, yeah, you and she are very similar because your IDs.
59:52
Is that a good a signature? No.
1:00:01
Bye bye. Here is a good signature. Meaning that if the signature, you just look at the signature, whether they are similar or not.
1:00:06
If the signature, say, yeah, these two are similar, then I guarantee you original document is also similar.
1:00:15
Okay. We beat this to death. Yeah.
1:00:27
Okay, good. Uh, feel free to ask questions.
1:00:31
You still have doubts? All right. Okay. So now we have signatures.
1:00:35
So we shrink it so much. Huge document now becomes 200 numbers let's say roughly.
1:00:42
So it depends on how many shuffling you do, the permutation you do and then use.
1:00:50
If you do it 100 times you get 100 numbers.
1:00:55
Okay. Now the reason we don't shuffle the pager, but is changing the index.
1:01:00
Because when we implement here, we have a very clever way to do it super fast.
1:01:05
Okay. How do I do this? Yes. So when I do the implementation, I keep each column.
1:01:12
I keep a number. Is. Did I find the one in that index?
1:01:21
Later on. I see another one. I will say, compared to the last time of the index, I see there is a one and this is a new one.
1:01:27
Is this index smaller than the other one? If it is, I am going to switch it.
1:01:36
I remember the smaller index. And then you only need to scan the polling matrix once.
1:01:41
Okay, so here it is. So you for each row, for each column you have a see if you see one in that row you remember the index.
1:01:51
Because there are so many times, let's say you have each function, you say h I e.
1:02:04
Then you keep a one and say, okay, that's a smallest index, I have it.
1:02:11
Uh, use this h to get the smallest one.
1:02:16
If the new one is smaller, then I'm going to remember the new one.
1:02:20
Throw away the old one. So by the time I finish these loop.
1:02:25
I have all the smallest index in my hand.
1:02:30
Yeah. Do you have to do it this way instead of just starting at the next one to?
1:02:35
Where you can try that way. Compared to this way, see who is faster.
1:02:42
This is super fast. You just read it once. Done.
1:02:48
There are many other ways to do it. I always say you have to find the fastest way.
1:02:54
Okay, everybody. So now I have these slides.
1:03:00
You go home, study. All right. And then make sure you understand these to begin with.
1:03:04
Every index I remember is a huge index, the largest the possible to begin with.
1:03:10
So later on I see a smaller one. I'm going to have to change this to be this smaller index.
1:03:17
So let's scan. Okay. I'm going to shuffle in twice.
1:03:23
H2 h1. This is the.
1:03:28
The hash function I use. Right now to begin with.
1:03:33
For row numbers zero, I see that's a one.
1:03:40
Right now because that's a one. And I need to say compare one to this infinity.
1:03:48
Who is smaller. The first one's a smaller. So I changed this to be one.
1:03:56
And then I do S2. Do I need to do anything? No, because that's a zero.
1:04:01
Okay. And then I do S3. Do I need to do anything? No.
1:04:07
Then S4 oh that's a one. So I say well index one.
1:04:11
Is it a compared to this guy. Yeah. That's also change it to be one.
1:04:15
Same thing when I do the index. The other index.
1:04:22
You remember when you do the index you have to say h1 is x1 plus one and then mode of five.
1:04:26
So that's the index. So you do this this after scanning signature.
1:04:34
And then the the lowest hash is S1 S4.
1:04:40
That's why s1 S4 changed.
1:04:44
The other S2. S3 did not change because I haven't see any ones in those documents yet because these two USB zero.
1:04:50
You know, if a document is lots of lots of zero or only few ones, that means what this document is a big or is a small.
1:05:03
Small. Yeah. Oh. Could it be very dumb?
1:05:13
Somebody write a huge document. Just repeat. That goes forever.
1:05:16
But those document is meaningless anyway. Okay. All right.
1:05:22
Now I am going to read the roll number two. Yeah, I don't understand.
1:05:26
You are excellent. Mhm. Defined by function X1X plus one modified.
1:05:32
Yeah. Then the last row is supposed to be the zero. So you're comparing the top one.
1:05:38
Though I'm only reading. These are old, but you should read the last two because each one is the bottom one.
1:05:46
Yeah. Look at this algorithm. Okay.
1:05:55
We're going three row by row for each column.
1:06:00
If we if that's a one. Right. Then for each hash function you consider.
1:06:03
This you consider the smallest value.
1:06:11
Then this m m is a variable.
1:06:15
M is this guy. Those are M's.
1:06:19
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then you compared. Now we're going to read the second row.
1:06:22
That's a zero. Do I need to do anything? Nothing.
1:06:29
Zero. Now, S3 is one.
1:06:33
The index of that is one. So look at the S3.
1:06:37
That's an infinity. So I need to change S3 here.
1:06:41
So look at this next slide. So.
1:06:44
Oh yeah. So S3. I say wow.
1:06:54
S3 has a. Has here.
1:06:58
Has a one here. That's index two.
1:07:02
That's why I change it to be two. Okay, and then nothing else but forever for the H2.
1:07:06
This index is why. H2, you put up one h2 one three plus it multiplied by one plus one mode by five it's four.
1:07:16
That's why you get a four. Everybody see you there?
1:07:30
Yeah. Now I'm gonna read the third row. You tell me which one would change.
1:07:35
This one and S2 and this. For weather they are going to change.
1:07:43
You have to compare the h value compared to the m value C if they are smaller.
1:07:48
If they're smaller, I change. If they are not smaller, I don't change.
1:07:54
Okay. So I do this look at two and three.
1:07:58
So. Luckily, S2 is too big, so definitely they're smaller than infinity.
1:08:02
But S4 you don't change it even though you see A1 because this index is greater than one, so you leave it at all.
1:08:09
Okay. And then you read the rule number three.
1:08:20
And then you you get this. You know the index.
1:08:24
This is even smaller. It's a zero. Okay.
1:08:28
And then you read number four, row number four. And then you change.
1:08:32
So this is the signatures you will find.
1:08:36
Just go through these. By, uh, pulling matrix ones, and you get the signature.
1:08:44
Very clever implementation, but the concept is judging a book by cover and then you shuffle the pages at the same time.
1:08:52
Okay, so let's have a break. And after that we continue the number three step.
1:09:03
You're shaking your head. It's too clever, isn't it? Uh, if if, uh, if we don't think about all that.
1:09:12
Yeah, yeah. Bag is.
1:09:31
You cannot use this matter directly. So you just keep it on the set?
1:09:35
Yeah. And. This similarity.
1:09:41
Uh, we just use the numbers. Yeah. The appearance similarity is you have two sets.
1:09:47
No, no, you cannot be a bank. Yeah, they are kind of similar.
1:09:59
Cannot be applied to bank because it has duplicates.
1:10:04
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If. We in this class we never use bank, but we just keep it a general.
1:10:10
That's why we say it could be applied. Okay.
1:10:19
So we don't. We're just supposed to believe that it works. We don't say the man has.
1:10:32
So your question is, uh, whether we can prove the similarity is preserved?
1:10:43
I'm assuming. Yes. We don't need it. We just. Yeah.
1:10:50
That's right. Yeah. So if you want, you can study it.
1:10:54
There are books to prove it. I don't understand why.
1:11:01
I don't know. I still have problems.
1:11:08
Okay, sure. Go ahead. Yeah. Like.
1:11:11
What you just told me. I think I don't understand.
1:11:16
What does the heart function actually improve on? Yes.
1:11:20
This is this h1 h2 is we take this index.
1:11:24
We compute after shuffling. What is the real index.
1:11:28
This represents the new index. That's another new index.
1:11:34
This is the original index. Yeah. So what are we interested in is in for each one.
1:11:38
What is the smallest index for H2. What's the smallest one.
1:11:44
That's why we are using those numbers when we have to compute it.
1:11:49
So so the first is like uh like repeated row by row, row by row.
1:11:55
And you look at these, you keep a memory of these m and these for these particular signature I h I what is the smallest index in terms of h I,
1:12:04
I have seen so far that the index is the one that's the original index.
1:12:18
But these originally used to be plug it into this H1 to get a new in there.
1:12:26
Yeah. So do we have a to index. Yeah.
1:12:32
But so if you plug in to 0001115 and then it's, you know this is x plus one.
1:12:35
If x is zero what is the index is one.
1:12:46
That's why it's a one. Yeah. This is a plus.
1:12:49
This is a multiplication. So this is different. So the new index becomes one because of hiring one with a you updated.
1:12:53
Yeah. Get the next row plot into the hash function.
1:13:02
Yeah. Yeah. Right. But you only update uh index.
1:13:06
That is like up here. Yeah. This is what do you remember if the new one comes is smaller than these, and then you replace it.
1:13:10
So you don't like, you don't update or you only have the one that.
1:13:20
You know why we don't update? Because there's no thing.
1:13:24
There's no. Yeah. So we're looking for an index.
1:13:28
Has a Shingo in it. But there's no Shingo there.
1:13:33
Yeah. Thank you. No, I, I I don't have a problem.
1:13:37
I think I understood all that, and I got lost in looking at where we go from the changes to the matrix.
1:13:44
Okay. Sure, sure sure, sure. So this is like the meaning that the meaning of these is don't.
1:13:51
Okay. So minimally go back to the slides that this shows up the first time you go you go.
1:13:58
Okay. First let me clarify. Is it single? Like if we have a list of words for English like English letters ABC and the K is two AB, AC 88, whatever.
1:14:06
All 26 to the power of two. Yeah okay.
1:14:18
Then not all of them then will show up in some in the upper right.
1:14:22
So whatever shows up in documents you sort of remember okay.
1:14:26
These you can go. You remember the numbers. Oh that was AB.
1:14:31
It was a C. And then so this then when you get to the matrix for the first time this would be AB, this will AC, this be 80.
1:14:35
So this is as many rows as yes. Yes yes okay.
1:14:46
That was my. Yeah. And this is just this is a shingles.
1:14:51
Yes. Yes. So this is a severe under-representation right.
1:14:55
This is right. Right. That's why you didn't cover page.
1:14:59
Yeah yeah yeah okay I think I'm going to go now to make it real world instead of letters.
1:15:03
If the document is a string that's my name is Jacob.
1:15:08
You can have my name. My is my Jacob's name.
1:15:12
Yeah. Let's say you're not looking at ABCd as a letter.
1:15:15
Yeah. You say I want to consider all the possible English word.
1:15:19
Yeah. So my name is Jacob, right.
1:15:22
So that's a full. Yeah. And then there is another shingle is Jacob.
1:15:26
Name was my. That's a different single.
1:15:32
And so those will be two different writers. Yeah. The document the first one would get a one right.
1:15:36
And the other one and up to a zero there. Right. That's probably never. All right.
1:15:41
Right, right. So you're going to have a lot of wasted. Yeah of course. And it's still more efficient.
1:15:45
This doesn't mean that it's not a because we don't remember this, but just conceptually we organize this way so we can we can do the clever things.
1:15:50
I talked about it before just okay I think I'm there.
1:16:00
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So for the quizzes, I've really been trying to like review the slides and the samples that you've talked about.
1:16:05
The review is. Not enough. Okay, you know what is the.
1:16:15
What is the key word you should use? Yeah.
1:16:19
You should not look at the answer. What you when you review it.
1:16:23
Just look at the question. Yeah. Are there like, specific examples?
1:16:26
We should use it from the textbook because sometimes I don't know where to start.
1:16:32
Like you, first you have to look at all the example I gave on the slide.
1:16:35
Can you solve it by yourself? Without a good answer?
1:16:39
That's a big toe. Yeah. You need to do that first.
1:16:43
Okay. I also wasn't sure if I was like. So the first question seems like a bit more conceptual, and this one seems like more applied.
1:16:46
So in the future, what do you mean by conceptual?
1:16:54
Like today's the concept, whereas this one is more like solving, like it's always whatever is on the slides you will be tested.
1:16:59
Okay. Okay. So besides the textbook in the slides, is there anything else?
1:17:08
That's too much to ask. Okay. You haven't done that yet, right?
1:17:14
I'm trying. I just I think it's also like probably proximal half of the time because I struggle with like time in this one.
1:17:20
That's why you did not practice, right. You need to practice.
1:17:26
Yeah. If you don't do practice, you will find yourself struggling like.
1:17:31
Oh, like how much time? It depends on the person.
1:17:36
Right? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
1:17:41
Thank you for that. So what I meant was written a few years ago.
1:17:51
I mean, in column, column similarity and column in this, I don't know.
1:17:59
It's my just to decide if they must be preserved similarities because.
1:18:05
The threshold will be always give to you. You don't decide that.
1:18:13
The customer decides. Yeah.
1:18:17
And regarding, uh, like we discussed earlier, uh, there is a discussion.
1:18:21
If the K is larger, the number of stimulus will decrease. To say no, it will increase.
1:18:26
I think the bigger the K, the more shingles you have.
1:18:31
So can you give an example? Of course. Let's say that uh uh uh, three shingles compared to two shingles.
1:18:37
Let's say you have an English 26 characters or, you know, uh, the affordability of three.
1:18:48
Yeah. So if intuition goes, how many shingles are there? No, it would be, uh, three multiplied by three.
1:18:57
So you have, uh, only ABC, right? You say?
1:19:09
Right. So I have a two shingles. That means I have two places to fill in.
1:19:13
So the first one has a three, because when you choose the one of the the second way is right.
1:19:19
So it's not. So if it's three shingles how many you have one for.
1:19:24
I mean it makes sense. Okay.
1:19:31
So you have four more. So basically uh, the number as the number of shingles increase, is that like uh document and multiply scale up I always like.
1:19:36
So is it 26 to 26. So what's your question again.
1:19:49
So my question is let's say. Let's take all 26 of x.
1:19:54
It is equal. Track of time.
1:20:01
Have we had a long enough break? Not enough.
1:20:25
He's eating dinner. Of course. All right, so we continue.
1:20:30
So we already finish the two. Two steps out of the three.
1:20:38
So the number three steps that we're going to cover. And then we're going to do a general discussion about it with the character's characteristics.
1:20:42
Then we're trying to do with the two applications of these in addition to find the similar documents.
1:20:50
You can find the similar fingerprints and you can find the similar news articles using this method.
1:20:57
Okay. So number three question is now we're pretty happy we got the signatures small enough out of the documents.
1:21:07
And then we want to use those signatures to again kick out those hopeless pairs of documents that they cannot be possibly similar to this.
1:21:16
Okay. Now how big are the similarity?
1:21:26
Uh, signatures. Now, here is signature.
1:21:30
It's short integers, but it's still it's a vector represents the document.
1:21:33
But if you want to compare, let's say pairwise Jaccard similarity between every pair of signatures.
1:21:40
That's a lot of work still. So you have to choose, let's say ten to the five and choose any two signatures for each signature.
1:21:51
That depends on how big the end is. You have to compare all the pairwise in the signature and then it takes six days to finish.
1:22:01
Still to be. You remember how wise that is?
1:22:13
Too big because there are so many signatures.
1:22:17
Because we have millions and millions of a document. Each document has a signature.
1:22:21
Right. And then you have that in terms of these, uh, the the tables.
1:22:26
Yeah. Every document is a column. Right.
1:22:32
How many columns are there? It's really equal to the number of documents you have.
1:22:36
See, it's a lots of a lots of color. Right.
1:22:42
How, uh, if you do the signature, how how many rows?
1:22:45
It depends on how many digits in the signature. But still lots of lots of columns.
1:22:51
So we still need to be careful. Oh, still in that too much work to do.
1:22:57
So what are we going to do? Is it going to do the bucket idea again?
1:23:03
Similar, but not exactly the same. So we're going to use throw all the signatures in a magic bucket.
1:23:08
See if they pass the bucket idea. We consider the similarity uh of the signature.
1:23:17
Otherwise we say wow, these two signature has nowhere to be similar.
1:23:23
Something like that. Okay. Okay.
1:23:28
So let's do this. So what are these table now?
1:23:32
Signature. How many? One. Two. Three.
1:23:43
Four. That means four documents we had, right?
1:23:46
So to consider column X and column Y.
1:23:50
Right. And then it's called a candidate A pairs. So we will have to consider those signatures.
1:23:55
Are they same. Are there different. And then eventually we use the Jaccard similarity.
1:24:02
To compute them. It's very straightforward.
1:24:07
It's just that it's just too many. All right.
1:24:10
So how do we cut it down. So we're going to use some ideas that uh.
1:24:14
We're going to divide the signature. So this is one signature one column.
1:24:20
We're going to divide the energy into B bands.
1:24:25
Then when we have a two signature, uh, we only compare band to band.
1:24:30
If a signature, uh, originated the big signature, another big center.
1:24:37
If the similar, then at least the one band in these two signature, they needs to be equal.
1:24:43
If none of them are in the band. And when you compare band to band, if they are not similar, then these two signature has no way to be similar.
1:24:53
So here we will see. Let's say the yellow is the signature thing.
1:25:03
Each column is one signature. And I divided how many bands.
1:25:13
51234. Now I'm considered the second the.
1:25:20
Okay, so I'm looking at this guy with this guy.
1:25:24
Right. So I throw them into a bucket. Hatchet is.
1:25:29
Notice this band throwing the second bucket.
1:25:34
This band throw into the number four bucket.
1:25:38
Are they the same? They are not the same.
1:25:41
Why? Because they got thrown into the different bucket.
1:25:46
Right. If they had the same, they were going to throw into the same bucket.
1:25:50
Right. Okay. Now look at who got throw into the same bucket.
1:25:54
This guy and this guy. They are all throw into the third sort of bucket, and the first one and the fifth one all throw into the second bucket.
1:26:03
So we will say that within this band.
1:26:17
One and the five. Is possible.
1:26:22
They are similar. Okay. And the two and the four are similar.
1:26:29
Now we only consider the. Okay. So that means column two and the six.
1:26:36
Uh. Two. Column two is this guy.
1:26:44
Column six is this guy. Sorry, I draw this picture like this.
1:26:48
Also throw that so they are probably identical because this throw into the same bucket.
1:26:53
Okay. Now column six and seven.
1:27:00
Uh, they are throwing to where? Sixes.
1:27:04
123. Four. Five six. This guy throwing.
1:27:07
Dude, this this guy is throwing into that. They are in different bucket.
1:27:11
That means they are definitely not the same. Okay.
1:27:16
So instead of looking at this band and compare, we just hash it into a bucket.
1:27:22
If they hatch into the same bucket, we say, yeah, they have a possibility to be the same.
1:27:29
Okay. So we do this band by band and then we have.
1:27:35
So. That's the key idea. The reason we do it is because there's so many columns there.
1:27:40
If we have 100,000 columns, that means representing 100,000 documents.
1:27:48
Okay. And the signature of, let's say each one is 100 integers one zeroth and total will be this 40MB.
1:27:53
And then if you divide it in 20 bands, each band has five rows.
1:28:04
Why is the 20 in the five? Because each signature is a 100.
1:28:09
And then I divide the five bands. Of course, each band is five.
1:28:19
All in that. Okay. So we can see if we use this method.
1:28:24
This is the key. Key, uh, slides we showed you before.
1:28:30
Okay. Now we're looking at the, uh, the.
1:28:35
The signature. If we do the band things in here, it's a prove is simple enough.
1:28:41
So we're going to do it. We're going to do the prove mathematically.
1:28:48
Prove it. So we compared to a pair of documents have a jackass similarity of T.
1:28:52
T is the threshold that's given to you.
1:29:01
Okay. Now column C1 and C2 in the signature should also have above the threshold similar t.
1:29:04
Now notice here this is the similarity. The magic Patty is that now I'm going to change the similarity to be probability.
1:29:16
Okay. Pick any bands are rows.
1:29:26
Okay. The probability all rows in the bands are equal.
1:29:32
What is the probability? Is that?
1:29:39
There's a probability T. That two bits at the same.
1:29:45
And then you have in the band you have arrows.
1:29:52
It will be t multiplied by t multiplied by t.
1:29:56
There is a R there. So this is the probability.
1:30:01
They are the same. The key part is that I change the T used to be a similarity.
1:30:06
That means if I say. If two columns is above the threshold, the T, that means if they are indeed at two columns,
1:30:14
the probability of each row they have the same number is t.
1:30:26
T is less than one. Greater than zero. You follow that sentence?
1:30:32
Yeah. So the similarity now I'm changing it to be a probability.
1:30:39
Okay then if the two. If the rows in the pan, they are all similar.
1:30:45
That means the probability of those two bands to be similar is this much.
1:30:53
Okay, now the probability. Not all the arrows are equal.
1:31:00
Is one minus that they or equal.
1:31:06
Okay. So this is requires a you know a little bit about probability.
1:31:13
I'm not teaching probability in this class assuming you know.
1:31:17
All right. So this is the okay. So if no band has roles that are all equal.
1:31:21
Each band. They are not. All robots are equal.
1:31:31
This is one minus t to the power of R, but we have B been.
1:31:35
So this is the whole if you take two signature.
1:31:44
No band has rows that are all equal.
1:31:48
Is this much? The probability of that.
1:31:52
Okay. If you have a trouble, you understand probability.
1:31:58
You sort of. You need to brush your knowledge about probability to make sure you do that.
1:32:01
Okay. Now at the least one band has roles that are all equal.
1:32:06
Is one minus that not all equal.
1:32:12
Okay, now, the reason I'm showing this, at least when Ben has roles that are not all equal.
1:32:18
Okay, so how do we know if I get a lot of a signature columns?
1:32:26
Uh, if I say. Okay.
1:32:31
Uh. If two signatures are indeed to be a candidate, meaning that survive the filter, then I need to say at least one common bucket.
1:32:36
They have to be at least one ban is identical means hashing into the same bucket.
1:32:51
All right. So this is a little bit of, uh, uh, not uh, because the bucket an idea equal.
1:33:00
So we use the bucket to sort of a similar to similarly the probability that they are equal.
1:33:09
So if two things are identical in one particular band we use this formula.
1:33:17
The probability of that is 0.8.
1:33:26
Is this tea? This is tea. Okay.
1:33:30
And the five because we have each band has a five row.
1:33:35
So T to the R is point eight to the power five.
1:33:40
That's the percentage. Okay.
1:33:44
So in other words, if you give me a t equals 0.8, it's a threshold.
1:33:49
Someone gave it to you. Then if. One band identical to each other.
1:33:54
The probability is this much. Because we use these to judge whether these two signature should be kicked out or should we keep it in?
1:34:01
So the probability they keep it in is this much.
1:34:11
Okay then. Probability of these two signature there are not similar in all 20 bands.
1:34:17
Is this much? Is this so?
1:34:27
In other words. If they are indeed similar, but our criteria kick them out.
1:34:31
The probability we have make a mistake is a very, very low.
1:34:38
It's, uh, sort of a 0.035%.
1:34:44
We'll make a mistake if we use the pen to judge it.
1:34:50
So we agree that we may make a mistake. But we tell you what's the probability of making a mistake?
1:34:56
So you feel comfortable, right? So in other words you have a point A and this is a probability.
1:35:05
So it's about this percentage that the 80% similarity gets.
1:35:12
Kick it out. Meaning we say it's a negative but it's not a negative.
1:35:17
It's a false negative. So the mistake we the probability of a mistake is this much.
1:35:23
Okay now. Now, what is the thing that we did right?
1:35:31
Meaning that we only kicked out the the bad ones.
1:35:37
The one that we keep. How likely they do be.
1:35:40
This is 99.965%. They are truly similar to.
1:35:44
It's quite good. All right.
1:35:50
So this is a t equals 0.8. If a t equals 0.3 we can plug the T into the similar formula.
1:35:54
T to the r. And this is the mistake. This is the probability that these are identical.
1:36:04
At least one of them. The probability we are making the negative.
1:36:11
The false positive example is that there are at least one band of 20.
1:36:18
Uh. Identical in at least one of the band.
1:36:25
Okay, so the probabilities equal this much.
1:36:31
In other words, if it is a bad one, we accepted it.
1:36:35
The probability is this much. The reason that's a transit, because we are giving this threshold a very low.
1:36:40
Meaning that, uh, depends on the tea we are given.
1:36:49
And we can calculate what's the likelihood.
1:36:54
What kind of a mistake, say, in the last slides, we're making the false negative in these slides we're making the.
1:36:57
The false positive, meaning that they are not similar, but we accepted them because the threshold is very low, so only 30%.
1:37:06
Okay, now I can change it to T to be many.
1:37:20
So here is the exercise. You go home to do it. Okay.
1:37:24
This is important. Look for false negative, meaning that we say it is negative.
1:37:29
We kick it in the mouth. But we were wrong. Then I gave you an example.
1:37:36
If t equals 80%, this is the probability we're making mistake.
1:37:41
And I want you to compute when the t is 90%, 100%, 70%, 60%, 50%.
1:37:47
What are the probabilities. Now clearly.
1:37:54
If. How many 200% similarities I missed.
1:37:58
We cannot possibly miss them. Zero chance we will make a mistake.
1:38:05
Why? Because they are everywhere.
1:38:11
They're identical. Of course they have one van.
1:38:15
At least one pair is identical.
1:38:19
Okay. On the other hand, is the false positive, meaning that we accepted them, but yet they were just not similar.
1:38:22
Okay. Now if they are totally not similar.
1:38:34
0%. Similar means these two pair of signature has nothing to do with each other.
1:38:39
Now the percentage. We make a mistake, of course, is zero.
1:38:47
Because you compute it. And we know that now.
1:38:52
I already gave you a slides. The example if I'm somebody gave me 30% similarity.
1:38:56
Do I accepted the chance I accepted yet I was wrong.
1:39:04
Is this much. And I want you to follow these two slides as an example to compute.
1:39:10
If t equals these these these and what's the number you fail in.
1:39:19
Okay. Right? Okay. All right.
1:39:26
Great. So go home. Do it. All right. Definitely need to do some homework.
1:39:31
Okay, so we are now looking at the choice of how many pans should I divide?
1:39:38
Right. So we decided 25 in there.
1:39:47
Then what if I change it, like maybe 25? And then each one of a row is only have four rows in.
1:39:51
What if I choose ten bands and there are lots of rows in each band?
1:39:58
So it depends on the B and R.
1:40:03
Notice that the different number we choose the t to the power of r and one minus a t to the power.
1:40:07
They all changes and then because they changes the probability we make a mistake, we also changes.
1:40:13
So if follows a picture and I get the this when I already computed the 80% similarity and the 30% similarity,
1:40:21
we use the different formula to compute the false negative and to compute the false positive.
1:40:34
And all these numbers I showed up when. This is b equals 15 r equals.
1:40:41
Five. Okay. And then the previous slides we discussed is 20 versus five.
1:40:50
Now is this a 1505. And again you can compute this again.
1:40:59
Depends on the B and R. How do you divide the signature into band?
1:41:05
All right. So ideally. Let's say this is the tea.
1:41:09
The similar threshold we call the s. Of course, the most ideal situation is that anything left over that we kick it out.
1:41:15
Anything right over this line. We accept it.
1:41:26
That would be ideal. No mistake mate.
1:41:30
Now notice that this is a Jaccard similarity, and this is the probability.
1:41:33
Okay. Now here is the probability equals zero.
1:41:41
Means what? Means that there's no way I'm going to accept anything below that threshold.
1:41:45
That would be ideal. But I only divided the signature into band and then rows.
1:41:53
So I have to sort of, uh. Give, uh, computing this.
1:41:59
Let's say, um, doing band one, row one.
1:42:06
This is sort of like a computer. So then the probability goes increases.
1:42:12
The more similar they are, the probability I'm accepting increases.
1:42:20
But I still make a mistake is that I have a threshold.
1:42:26
Right below that threshold. I actually reject everything.
1:42:32
Yet I accepted this part. Above threshold.
1:42:35
I should accept everything yet. I rejected this part because they are below this.
1:42:40
So overall, here's the curve.
1:42:46
It's called S curve is made by this one minus t one minus parenthesis one minus t.
1:42:50
So looking at this picture.
1:42:59
The green area. Is we make a mistake.
1:43:05
Meaning that it's a false negative.
1:43:09
The reason is negative because they are left side of my S-curve.
1:43:13
Therefore, I'm using the S-curve to judge.
1:43:20
So anything on the left hand side of my S-curve I reject yet.
1:43:24
I did not reject them. Okay. So in the false negative, meaning that, uh, I rejected them,
1:43:30
yet they are good in the sense that they are on the right hand side of the true threshold.
1:43:38
All right. So the green part is the false negative that I made.
1:43:48
Now the blue part is the false positive I made, meaning that I should have rejected them.
1:43:53
However, they are on the right hand side of my curve, so I accepted them.
1:44:01
I made a mistake. So that's a blooper.
1:44:08
The funny thing is that if I change B and there are these curve moves left in the right.
1:44:12
If you want to reduce the green part because you have the S-curve, you have to accept a lot of blue parts.
1:44:22
If you wanted to reduce the blue parts and you have to accept the more green parts.
1:44:29
The reason because I did not get the vertical bar.
1:44:35
Instead I get this S-curve. Because I'm using the band and roll.
1:44:38
Idiot. Okay, so this. How do you compute these things?
1:44:46
It's really depends on R and B. And you change that.
1:44:50
The this S-curve moves. That's why the exercise I want you to do.
1:44:56
You feel that movement? With different R and BS.
1:45:03
Yeah. Question. We just more hash functions. So they could have better.
1:45:08
No matter how much you do it. You cannot get the vertical thing.
1:45:12
Because you are still guessing you. We are throwing things into the bucket.
1:45:18
There is always a price we have to pay. Yes.
1:45:28
We want to do things fast. And then we have to pay a certain price.
1:45:32
Now the reason we can get a read of those, the cover page thing.
1:45:39
Because at the next pass we will do an honest the checking the all these are just prepare us to kick out all those useless pairs.
1:45:43
That's the key idea. Now, even in the kicking out part, we're making mistakes.
1:45:54
And this is how much mistakes we are making. A question that is changing for me.
1:46:02
Mhm. Mhm. This is always different. Yes.
1:46:11
A shape and maybe depends on how big is your signature.
1:46:16
And then the other is. But R&B sort of shifting the position.
1:46:20
Now look at the exercise I ask you to do. Okay.
1:46:27
This is meaning. R and B are both fixed.
1:46:33
P is 20. R is five.
1:46:40
Then you can easily give yourself more exercise today.
1:46:45
I'm going to change this to be 15. And then 15.
1:46:49
How many rows in there? Okay. We have 15 ro five.
1:46:55
If you change these 15 and five.
1:47:01
And you will get a different set of number. So the position sort of a shifting a little bit.
1:47:06
Nevertheless you still making the green arrow. You still making the blue arrow.
1:47:13
Nothing you can avoid because we are approximating it.
1:47:19
Okay. So. Now because we have this S-curve.
1:47:25
Right. This is S-curve. And then somebody gave us a threshold.
1:47:31
Let's say if I have this S-curve, what would be the best cut off place is somewhere in between, in the middle.
1:47:36
So this is the S-curve. This is the S-curve.
1:47:44
You notice that the T equals a .2.3.
1:47:49
This is the probability, the threshold. Somebody gave it to you.
1:47:54
Where is the. Suppose you have to choose the a b band one band, at least one band.
1:47:58
And the T lost. So notice that what is the biggest.
1:48:06
The jump here is a 0.0 or 6.7.
1:48:10
The biggest. The jump is from here to here.
1:48:14
Two here. So the threshold, the cutoff in between.
1:48:19
Is somewhere in the middle. Okay.
1:48:24
All right. So that's the green part. So then you will see here in this example let's say our 100 is the size of our signature.
1:48:30
And I'm choosing 50 bands. Each panel has only two rows.
1:48:41
And this is the idea the the middle part that one over B and one over r is where the threshold is ID or threshold is.
1:48:47
So it depends on the threshold. You can actually say how many bees?
1:49:02
How many hours should I decide? It's.
1:49:08
It really depends on the teeth. That's a given to you.
1:49:11
The key is that vertical red bar. When you have a different tees, this vertical bar moves.
1:49:17
So wherever that T is you should at the just your s position sort of fit that thing at the most places.
1:49:24
You don't want to make a lot of green arrows, no blues, or you don't want to make a lot of blue arrows with no green arrows.
1:49:35
You want a sort of a balance these to. Okay.
1:49:43
That's the key idea. All right. So then. So these are the examples.
1:49:49
And then you can uh. Now how do I get this number.
1:49:54
Of course you're using this formula to do it.
1:49:58
So everybody's quiet. Any questions? Yeah.
1:50:06
All right. Quick. So similarity.
1:50:09
Now we're using the signature M the band and R to identify all the candidates.
1:50:12
And we use these method to eliminate kick out.
1:50:22
So the more official word is eliminate, not kick out and all the most the pairs that do not have similar things that we can do.
1:50:27
So because if we did these, we dramatically cut down the possible pairs of the document that we need to check honestly.
1:50:36
Okay. So. In summary, these are the three steps.
1:50:48
And you remember the first step is very easy. The second step is how do you construct the signature okay.
1:50:54
The third step is that you sort of use the bucket idea and the band and the roles, sort of make sure you kick out only those hopeless pairs,
1:51:02
and then the way you choose B and R depends on whatever the threshold is that's given to you,
1:51:15
and then you want to adjust the things that best suited the signature.
1:51:21
The threshold. Okay. This is a similar.
1:51:27
After these I'm going to give you two applications. How do we use the same idea to do the fingerprints?
1:51:32
And also you know that people do fingerprints.
1:51:40
This is very useful for people who do the FBI does that are all about.
1:51:43
Okay. So the combining technique, the shingles and the sorting and the computing,
1:51:51
the signature, these are the ideas that we have covered in the slides tonight.
1:52:00
So I put it here just sort of help you summarize what we went through.
1:52:06
And then you should have idea when you see the sentence you say, okay, I know what you means when you read these.
1:52:12
If you say, I have no idea what are you talking about? That means you have to go back to the early slides and make sure you understand, okay?
1:52:20
Okay. So these are called the locality hashing technique.
1:52:30
And that we have used the locality sensitive.
1:52:36
You know anybody knows why it's called the locality. Because depends on how you choose to be and the location of these S-curve changes.
1:52:40
Right. And you wanted to find the best location for it.
1:52:50
That's right. It's called the locality. Sensitive.
1:52:54
Locality sensitive. Okay. Okay, good. So locality sensitive, you say?
1:53:00
Well, I know I have to use the hash function to bucket, and I say I have to divide it into the band and roles and things like that.
1:53:06
Okay. So eventually I come up with this S-curve.
1:53:15
This is the best I can do. And I can adjust the location of this S curve by changing the B and R's, and then the shifting.
1:53:20
It depends on where the threshold is given to you, and you want to find the best location for it.
1:53:29
So who can be use of those, right. The functions can be used including the mean hash function that we, we we talked about just now.
1:53:38
Mean hash is the second step where we construct the signature three conditions for the family of functions that can be applied.
1:53:48
This locality thing is that more likely to make close pairs be identity pairs than the distance pairs, meaning that if two pairs they are far away.
1:53:57
That means they are less likely to be similar. If they are closer, that be more likely.
1:54:12
I emphasize two were likely to be similar.
1:54:20
Okay, you cannot say I have a function goes the other way.
1:54:24
The longer the distance, the more likely they are to be similar.
1:54:29
That's, I guess, that these characteristics and the statistically they need to be independent.
1:54:33
You cannot repeatedly use the same hash function to do this things because that one.
1:54:41
Like last week we talk about that. If you just do this, use the same hash function to get a bitmap y bitmap to.
1:54:46
You're wasting your time. Right. And then the efficient in two ways.
1:54:54
Be able to identify candidate pairs in time, and then view the function better than to avoid a false positive and a false negative.
1:55:00
Okay. Those are the families of things.
1:55:12
So notice that this S-curve, if we do the the we can if we do the distance, like I say, the the more distance,
1:55:15
the longer the distance, the probability they be classified as a, uh, similarity should go down.
1:55:24
Because they are far away. So this horizontal is the distance.
1:55:34
This is the probability. If they are very close to each other.
1:55:40
See the probability goes high. And here is probability goes low when they are far away.
1:55:44
But the in the middle. We cannot analyze it.
1:55:50
There is no ideological solution for the middle. It's only, um, we have a D1 and D2 greater than D1.
1:55:55
For sure. The probability will go down. Less than D1.
1:56:04
For sure the probability will go up close to zero, but in the middle there is a fuzzy fuzzy area because it's hard to say it.
1:56:09
That's why the locality sensitivity showed up here again.
1:56:20
All right. So, uh, you can use this for many places.
1:56:26
And, uh, this is, uh, uh, the English description of this picture that if it's, uh, if it's this distance less than one, we have a probability.
1:56:33
If it's a distance greater than v2, we have a problem.
1:56:47
So overall this is equal to d1 d2 p1 p2 sensitivity is also called a locality sensitivity.
1:56:51
So look at this picture shows up. This d1 d2 p1 p2.
1:57:00
In this area we have nothing to say.
1:57:08
Okay. All right. Okay, so today we learned Jaccard distance.
1:57:13
In the future. Uh, we already know the Euclidean distance.
1:57:23
We haven't learned the cosine distance yet. Okay.
1:57:28
And the edited this and not yet Hamming distance here. There are many other distance we can use.
1:57:31
Not just the Jaccard. Jaccard distance. This is a good of what, two sets.
1:57:37
Some number of people ask me now for two bags.
1:57:43
Okay. That's important. Banks is sort of like a little bit of a fuzzy feeling there.
1:57:48
Jakarta. Okay. Now I'm going to describe two quick applications.
1:57:56
And then and then you will see it is useful. Yeah fingerprints is definitely very useful now.
1:58:02
You remember when we do the document? What do we change the document into?
1:58:11
First step. Shingles. Now look at the fingerprints.
1:58:18
Look at your own fingerprints. This finger.
1:58:22
Nothing is identical. Do you know?
1:58:25
How do we judge? What is the shingle for?
1:58:28
The fingerprints? Mhm.
1:58:31
Battle patterns. What kind of patterns? This is something not many people know.
1:58:38
I didn't know before I studied. This is something we call the menu here.
1:58:46
What is the minutiae in your fingerprints? You look at your fingerprint. There are so close.
1:58:54
So close. There's some branches. Right. What do we need to find is the branching point.
1:58:58
Those are called the minuto. Is this. See branching places.
1:59:05
These are the key points in your fingerprints.
1:59:13
And the ever with is when you her is different location, uh, different orientation and just different.
1:59:17
Of course, there are lots of my circles. When I was a kid, I would look at, oh, fingerprints that are just a lot of circles, right?
1:59:27
It's more than that. It's a miniature. I don't know.
1:59:35
Minutia is the adjacent the great squares and they showed up this pattern.
1:59:39
That's where you turn. So we looking the location of this menu, trying anybody's fingerprints.
1:59:46
We remember the location. And then we use that to do the similarity matching.
1:59:55
So instead of a changing document to the, uh, shingles, we changing fingerprints to this menu.
2:00:03
All right. So the menu. So is is the place of grade over fingerprint.
2:00:11
Represent fingers of a best set of great points where menu tries are located.
2:00:16
I am not a native English speaking people. Can anybody tell me what is original meaning of a neutron?
2:00:25
Any idea? No. Okay. This is probably a Greek word somewhere.
2:00:33
Yeah. Anyway, just. Just this. Okay.
2:00:39
This is called the menu. That's all you need to. This is located there.
2:00:42
And this is typically, uh, we we get a great say, oh, this is the place I find this location.
2:00:47
That's right. That's the great square. We do it.
2:00:57
So now we're changing fingerprints to be a bunch of those menu choice.
2:01:01
Of course. How many possible menu tries? Like how many possible shingles in a document?
2:01:08
You can think of all sorts of a menu in everybody's possible fingerprints.
2:01:14
Of course you pick a particular single fingerprint.
2:01:20
You look at a long list of minutiae. Not all of them shore up your fingerprints.
2:01:23
If we say, oh, number five shows up and then number 2026.
2:01:28
Oh, it's all my finger. So I have two menu choices.
2:01:34
But that long list of menu is there. It's all possible locations that people might have.
2:01:38
Okay, so then you can use that to represent the fingerprints.
2:01:46
And then we will do this sort of a bucket ization to kick out all the pairs of fingerprints.
2:01:50
That is not possible. There are similar.
2:01:59
It could be like these totally different locations of a totally different sets of them.
2:02:03
And then these two fingerprints are not similar.
2:02:09
Okay, so we wanted to find a sort of a, uh, two kinds of application.
2:02:13
If somebody's bad, something somewhere, a bad thing happen, and we collect the fingerprints from the the scenery,
2:02:20
the bad guys fingerprints, and we, the FBI, take it a home.
2:02:30
Say, does it match my huge database database of fingerprints?
2:02:34
Right. That's a quite a one to many mapping.
2:02:40
If you go home. Yeah, I recognize this fingerprint.
2:02:46
It's the same guy two years ago. Killed someone somewhere other than you.
2:02:50
Can you say this is the same bad guy, right?
2:02:55
The other one is called many. Too many. So you have many, uh, possible fingerprints match.
2:02:59
Too many possible. You collected a bunch of them, you say?
2:03:07
Are they similar to each other? And then you ask if there a interaction.
2:03:11
Okay. So of course, uh. The.
2:03:17
The significance of making a mistake is bad.
2:03:22
You don't want to make too many mistakes. Now you can say, uh.
2:03:27
Man matching a single fingerprints to a database.
2:03:32
So you better not missing all those fingerprints in the database.
2:03:37
There is a similar to this guy. So that is if you missing these.
2:03:43
I think caught a pass. Negative. False negative or kind of false positive.
2:03:48
First negative because you say they are not. But they should be, right?
2:03:55
That's a false. So false negative is a mistake that you are trying to avoid.
2:03:59
But false positive is okay in the sense it's less significant.
2:04:06
You. Yeah. Blame someone. Good. If we did, possibly he did bad things.
2:04:12
Yeah, but we were later our investigation.
2:04:16
We are clear five. But you don't want to miss any possible bad guys.
2:04:19
Okay, so what's that say? Okay, so let's see.
2:04:24
Compare all the fingerprints. Many to many.
2:04:28
You can throw fingerprints into the bucket.
2:04:32
If two fingerprints throw into the same bucket, you say yes.
2:04:35
It's possible these two are the same. All right.
2:04:39
Okay. So many to one. Problem is find the fingerprints in your database.
2:04:44
Okay. It's, uh. And and also, you wanted to for a new fingerprints, determine which packet it belongs to you.
2:04:50
You have all the data, uh, fingerprints. You know, the the ways they are in the packets.
2:05:00
You throw them in the packet, and you throw this new ones into a packet.
2:05:05
Then all the similar things throw in the same packet that you compared to all the other fingerprints in those packets.
2:05:10
And then you will find the possibility. Okay.
2:05:18
So. How do we compare?
2:05:22
Right. Uh. The two. We're going to use it. Uh, so, you know, typically finger fingerprint as, uh.
2:05:26
20% in the grading points.
2:05:35
You have a neutral. I think I have a less than 20%.
2:05:39
Some people may have more than 20%, so average 20%.
2:05:43
You have the majority. Uh. Fingerprints.
2:05:48
If we suppose fingerprints from the same finger.
2:05:53
And you. Put a fingerprint there. You take these two fingerprints.
2:05:57
Agreed. At least 80%.
2:06:03
That means possibly these two prints come from the same finger.
2:06:07
This are the assumption we're making. Okay. So 80%.
2:06:15
So like the threshold we're talking about right. Yeah.
2:06:19
So the probability of two random fingers each have one in all three points over same menu
2:06:22
is 20% because we have three grades from one fingerprint and then the three from the other,
2:06:32
they are all equal is power to the six. So the probability is very low if you pick two random fingers.
2:06:40
They are matching in all three points. It's very low.
2:06:49
It's this much love. Okay. Yeah. So that's.
2:06:55
So we we compute probability two fingerprints from the same finger has 1 in 3 given points when you chop.
2:06:59
Okay. Now look of other place. It is. 20%.
2:07:09
The, uh. Uh. Randomly.
2:07:15
There's 20%. It should have have something there. If they are indeed matching 80% they are matching would consider.
2:07:19
And then there are three points. So the probability you say, well these two prints are from the single uh finger.
2:07:28
Is the mistake you are making is point four percentage.
2:07:37
If you look at the menu charts. Okay. All right.
2:07:44
So at least one of the each finger, we represent them as a 1024 sets of three points.
2:07:48
So those are the possible number of sort of a shingles we could consider.
2:07:57
Right. Is one minus there. So this is again the formula we're talking about.
2:08:02
This is the B. And this is the t things there.
2:08:08
So and then you can compute if they indeed have those matching is 80%.
2:08:15
So the random finger if they do matching is this.
2:08:22
Very low. Okay. So that's what are we computing okay.
2:08:29
The reason is that point two is if the first image has one in a point, that's the 20% because we assume 20% randomly and they have it.
2:08:34
And the second point eight is a second image has the same finger.
2:08:47
Also half of that it's 80% a chance.
2:08:51
Two guys have, you know, similar things happening there.
2:08:54
So this is the we the probability we're making negative force negative is 1.5%.
2:09:01
It's not too bad. So we're missing some, but not too bad.
2:09:12
The false positive we're making is 63%.
2:09:16
If we use the menu, I think. Okay.
2:09:22
So those are the. So this is analogous to the t to the R that we learned in the in the previous slides.
2:09:26
And then you can plug in verify it.
2:09:35
This is analogous to that one minus one minus t to the r band of b.
2:09:38
So when this is the band. We're talking about.
2:09:45
This is an application for fingerprints. Okay.
2:09:50
So in general you choose the number of functions. And then uh, whenever we do the uh, signature part, uh, we want to choose uh,
2:09:57
matching fingerprint and then uh, has not too many false positive, uh, not too many, uh, false negative.
2:10:08
So this is one application that you can apply in the future.
2:10:18
You may encounter others. So the idea is that if you encounter any problem, someone will.
2:10:23
And once you compare, find it to a similar set.
2:10:29
Remember, it has to be two sets. Similar in that you can consider this technique.
2:10:36
Okay. Right. But if it's in that sense a single thing like a milk, diapers and coke, then that's using the technique that we talked about last week.
2:10:45
Okay. The last application is finding news articles and you say, well, what's new about it?
2:11:01
Because we're talking about documents already. News article is a document.
2:11:07
The complication is that in the news article there are a lot of commercials in it.
2:11:12
If we do the shingle business as usual, we find a lot of similarities in a lot of news articles because they contains the same commercial.
2:11:19
That's bad. So we need to find a way to kick out those commercial.
2:11:33
Part of it. How do we do this? It's interesting.
2:11:38
Is something we called. Uh.
2:11:42
There's a. Cut the stopwords.
2:11:47
What is this? Stopwords? Stop. Word is a common words like and and v and things like this.
2:11:53
So if you have a commercial right and you don't see those words.
2:12:03
If it's a regular document. In the news article, you'll see those words, for example by pseudo versus a language essay.
2:12:10
I recommend that you buy Sudoku for your lingerie.
2:12:21
Notice that I. That you for your.
2:12:27
Those are called stopwords. Those stop words intended to be used in the regular writing?
2:12:35
Yeah, news article is irregular. Writing has a lot of stop words while commercials don't use the.
2:12:43
You understand why? Because the commercial people have to pay.
2:12:54
The last words they use, the better and the cheaper they can get.
2:12:59
That's why all the commercials have no stop words.
2:13:04
So what do we do? Before we do, we change it to the shingle.
2:13:08
We need to say we are only interested in those shingles who contains stopwords?
2:13:13
If a shingle has no stopwords, we don't want to consider.
2:13:21
That way you suddenly changing all the news articles and you kick out all the commercial pot automatically.
2:13:27
Then you apply the rest of the techniques we talk about today and everything works out, and then you just ignore those commercial.
2:13:37
This is a one trick that you can use. It's called stopwords.
2:13:47
The rest of it is the same. It's just the first step.
2:13:52
You do that. Okay.
2:13:56
I think, uh, this is, uh. Uh, all we need to talk about today.
2:13:59
So compared to similar sets, it's very tough because not only there are many, many objects and each object is so many, many components.
2:14:06
Okay. How are you doing?
